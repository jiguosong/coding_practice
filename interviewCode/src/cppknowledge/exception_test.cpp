look at the smart pointer too!!!!

For constructor and destructor,
!!!itâ€™s ok to throw in a constructor but never throw in a destructor

that destructors are only called for fully constructed objects.
So if an exception is thrown in the main body of the constructor,
the destructors for all the data members are called but the
destructor for the object being created is not.
